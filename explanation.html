  <h2>What is Crochet?</h2>
  <p>
    <dfn>Crochet</dfn> needlework consisting of the interlocking of looped stitches formed with a single thread and a hooked needle. <cite>Merriam-Webster Dictionary</cite>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
  <h2>A Quick History</h2>
    <p> Crochet: craft that developed in the 19th century out of a form of chain-stitch embroidery done with a hook instead of a needle. In crochet work the hook is used, without a foundation material, to make a texture of looped and interlinked chains of thread. In the late 1840s crochet was introduced into Ireland as a famine relief measure. In southern Ireland the industry centred in Cork, in northern Ireland at Clones in County Monaghan. As it became more sophisticated, crochet work approximated lace, antique laces such as gros point de Venise, or Venetian raised lace, being successfully imitated. <cite>Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></p>

  <h2>Crochet Today</h2>
  <p>
  Like many handcrafts, crochet dipped in popularity during the rise of mass-produced goods. And like many handcrafts, it never really disappeared; it just waited. Today, crochet is thriving again. Social media, online tutorials, digital patterns, and vibrant maker communities have made it easier than ever to learn, experiment, and connect. Crochet appeals to a wide range of people: those who love tradition, those who want fast creative gratification, and those who simply enjoy making something real with their hands. It also helps that crochet is wonderfully accessible. A hook, some yarn, and a bit of curiosity will get you started. <cite>Motherknitter.com</cite>
